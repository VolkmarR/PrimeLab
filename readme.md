# Exercise Prime Numbers

This exercise is used to practice test driven developement and performance benchmarking.

# Tasks

1) Use TDD to create a simple function, that detects, if a number is a prime number.
2) Implement a benchmark to see the memory usage and execution time
3) Try to optimize the prime number function

# Definition

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself. 
A factor is a whole number that can be divided evenly into another number. 
The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29. 
Numbers that have more than two factors are called composite numbers. 
The number 1 is neither prime nor composite.
0 and negative numbers should be considered invalid parameters.
